# ALX Airbnb Database Project

This repository contains SQL scripts and documentation for the **Airbnb Clone Database** project as part of the ALX Software Engineering program.  
The goal is to design, query, and optimize a relational database that powers the backend of an Airbnb-like system.

## 📂 Project Structure

- database-adv-script/ → Advanced SQL queries (joins, subqueries, views, etc.)
- Other folders → Contain database setup scripts, schema definitions, and requirements.

## 📝 Current Task

- **Complex Queries with Joins**  
  - joins_queries.sql → SQL queries demonstrating INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN.  
  - README.md (inside database-adv-script/) → Documentation for join queries.

## 🚀 Learning Objectives

- Understand how to use different SQL joins:
  - INNER JOIN → Combine rows with matching keys in both tables.
  - LEFT JOIN → Include all records from the left table even without matches.
  - FULL OUTER JOIN → Include all records from both tables, with NULLs where no match exists.
- Write efficient queries to retrieve meaningful insights from relational data.
- Structure SQL scripts in a maintainable way for collaboration.
